# obsidian-pocket

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to sync your
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) reading list into Obsidian, so that you can
easily create Obsidian notes directly from your Pocket reading list.

## Installation

The plugin will soon be installable from the "Community plugins" settings tab
in Obsidian, as described
[here](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Third-party+plugins#Discover+and+install+community+plugins).

## Usage

### Settings

After the plugin has been enabled, you will be able to see a "Pocket" option
under the "Plugin options" section of the settings panel, as shown below.

### Connecting your Pocket account and syncing Pocket items

Click on "Connect your Pocket account" to begin the Pocket authorization flow by
opening a web page on your default browser. You will be asked whether you want
to give permission to this plugin to access your Pocket data. Then you will be
redirected back to Obsidian.

If you granted permission to this plugin to access Pocket data, you can click on
"Sync Pocket items" to actually download and store your Pocket list locally
within Obsidian.

You can also sync your Pocket items using an Obsidian command: "Sync Pocket list".

### Opening and using the Pocket list

Once the Pocket list is downloaded and stored, open the command palette and
search for "Pocket" to see the list of available commands. The single command
currently available is "Open Pocket list". The Pocket list is shown in a
screenshot above.

### Notes for Pocket items

Click on any Pocket item's title to create a note (or navigate to an existing
note) for that Pocket item. Notes for Pocket items will be created in the Pocket
item notes folder, which can be configured in settings.

Open the Pocket item URL in your browser using Meta+click for Linux and Mac OS
(e.g. command+click on Mac OS) and using Alt+click for Windows.

Meta+click (e.g. command+click on Mac OS) to open the Pocket item URL in your browser.

Notes in Obisidan are matched to Pocket items based on their name. If you find
this setup limiting, please file a feature request (see bottom of this README
for how to do that).

A template for new Pocket item notes can be specified in settings.

## Using templates for Pocket notes

Templates for Pocket notes work similar to any other template in Obsidian, see
[here](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates), except that only the
following variables are supported:

| Variable name | What it means                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{title}}`   | The title of the Pocket item                        |
| `{{url}}`     | The URL of the Pocket item                          |
| `{{excerpt}}` | The excerpt extracted by Pocket for the Pocket item |
| `{{tags}}`    | The Pocket tags for the Pocket item                 |

Here's an example template that will put this metadata into the [YAML
frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) of the
note for the Pocket item:

```
---
Title: {{title}}
URL: {{url}}
Tags: {{tags}}
Excerpt: >
    {{excerpt}}
---
{{url}}
{{tags}}
```

If you had saved [this
URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027908/carbon-removal-hype-is-a-dangerous-distraction-climate-change/)
to Pocket, synced it to Obsidian using this plugin and then created a note for
the corresponding Pocket item with the above template, your note would start off
containing the following:

```
---
Title: Carbon removal hype is becoming a dangerous distraction
URL: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027908/carbon-removal-hype-is-a-dangerous-distraction-climate-change/
Excerpt: In February, oil giant Shell trumpeted a scenario in which the world pulls global warming back to 1.5 ÀöC by 2100, even as natural gas, oil, and coal continue to generate huge shares of the world‚Äôs energy.
